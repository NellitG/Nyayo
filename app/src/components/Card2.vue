          Nyayo  was established in 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya, with a passionate commitment to empowering differently-abled children through access to digital education.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-950 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The NGO was founded to address the educational and social disparities faced by children with disabilities in underserved communities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-950 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Recognizing that these children often lack the resources and support to thrive in conventional educational settings, Nyayo aims to bridge this gap by providing inclusive, accessible, and technology-driven learning opportunities.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-950 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We believe that continuous learning is key to personal and organizational growth, and we strive to instill this value in the children we serve.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-950 leading-relaxed">
          We are committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of differently-abled children by providing quality education and resources.
