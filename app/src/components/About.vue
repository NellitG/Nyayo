          Who Are We
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-900">
          Nyayo Inc was established in 2024 in Nairobi, Kenya, with a passionate commitment to empowering differently-abled children through access to digital education.
          The NGO was founded to address the educational and social disparities faced by children with disabilities in underserved communities.
          Recognizing that these children often lack the resources and support to thrive in conventional educational settings, Nyayo Inc aims to bridge this gap by providing inclusive, accessible, and technology-driven learning opportunities.
          Since its inception, the organization has grown rapidly, partnering with schools and communities to foster an environment of inclusivity.
