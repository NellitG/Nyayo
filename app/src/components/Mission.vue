            To ensure that every differently-abled child/individual has access to quality digital education, has access to the same opportunities as any other child/individual, despite their background differences.
            We envision a future whereby every differently-abled child/individual thrives emotionally, professionally and physically, and whereby diversity is a stepping stone to greatness rather than an obstacle.
